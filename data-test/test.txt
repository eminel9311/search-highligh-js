Love is the greatest gift we can ever hope to give or receive. Love is the one thing that can overcome so many of the difficult times that we are faced with in life. Love is so powerful – it can turn frowns into smiles. It can help mend the most broken heart. It can even turn all of the ugliness in the world into the most beautiful portrait we could ever have the pleasure to behold.

Such a monumental task – of course… it could be. But only if we try to do it alone. Instead, if each of us, in our own small way contributed just a little – together, the task can become the reality we’re reaching for.

As potent as what love can be, it can only work it’s magic if we choose to allow it to. For that to come to pass we must let go of the other emotions that can get in love’s way. How is that – you may wonder?

Love can help us to get rid of all emotions: anger, harshness,  impatience, envy, mistakes, revenge, perfection, expectations.

Instead of any of the above, consider these options…

Take the time to know each other’s heart – when you do you will be more understanding and less apt to misunderstand another’s intentions, which probably were never meant to hurt or upset you to begin with.

Smile more often – it may cause a few wrinkles, at the very least, but then so does frowning. You choose what kind you’d rather have. And as you ponder that choice, keep in mind that they can both be contagious. Wouldn’t you rather be greeted by smiles than frowns?

Love causes less stress, less heartache, less misunderstandings, less of just about everything negative. Love does reap rewards – happiness, health, joy, peace, and so much more that’s positive. Isn’t that what we want most for this world of ours? Isn’t this a much prettier picture? Remember the portrait? It’s not impossible and we can all help to paint it. We can at least try, right? Think about it…

What is love? Love is a very special and meaningful word to each human being. Each human being has his/her own thoughts about love to guide himself/herself to land safely and smoothly into the kingdom of Love. Without this preconceived idea of love, people would be acting like a blind person searching for the light with thousand of obstacles in front of him.

What is Love? I know this question exists in each human being’s mind including myself. If not it is still waiting to be discovered deeply in your heart. What do I think of love? For me, I believe love is a priceless diamond, because a diamond has thousands of reflections, and each reflection represents a meaning of love.

Love is patient, love is kind, and everlasting. With love I can accept a person’s imperfections without any condition, and able to transfer the way I love myself to another person who I am fancy at. With love I can have the power against loneliness, sadness, and illness, and to be able to change them into my happiness. As well as, having a key to open my heart to look at this world without a mask, to show people who I really am.

Perhaps love is like religion- something we just need to believe in to have, or achieve. Perhaps it is just a thought. If we feel it in our hearts and believe it in our souls, then just maybe it will be there to feel and cherish. .

What will happen if people live without love? In my point of view, without love I may lose my ability to survive in this world with no hope. Without love I can be defined as a rat living in the sewer, with no chance to see our beautiful land and with no chance to lighten up myself against the darkness. As well as, I may lose many opportunities of enjoyment both mentally and physically, when I do not know what love is.

We don’t know exactly what love is and where it comes from. But one thing is sure: we are nothing without love!
